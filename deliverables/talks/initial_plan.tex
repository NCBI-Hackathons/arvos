\begin{block}{Motivation}
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a dynamic and interactive results display environment (Flask)
  \begin{itemize}
  \footnotesize
   \item Include both associative and \highlt{predictive} statistics
  \end{itemize}
  \item Create an environment that encourages model comparison
 \end{enumerate}
\end{block}  

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Apply it to a meta-analysis of asthma (reference assemblies) 
  \item Apply it to a \textit{de-novo} assembly from a unpublished butterfly species
  \item Create nice documentation using Sphinx
  \item Dockerize the databases and WebApp for ease of use
 \end{itemize}

% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Unlike many other tools, it is designed to handle data on a scale relevant to 
% modern problems.
%  \item Most of the core algorithms rely on extremely fast legacy code 
%  \item Highly flexible graph implementations (a graph/node can be anything!)
%  \item Extensive set of native readable and writable formats
%  \item Takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s ability to pull data from the Internet or databases
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \keywd{When to AVOID NetworkX to perform network analysis?}
% \begin{itemize}
%  \item Large-scale problems that require faster approaches (i.e. Facebook/Twitter 
% whole social network...)
%  \item Better use of resources/threads than Python
